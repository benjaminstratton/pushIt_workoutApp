# Push-It - Workout App

## Description

With over 3+ years of personal training experience and several more in my own personal training regimen, I have consistently been asked to share routines and tips for getting started! Therefore, Push-it was born to do two fundamental things: provide sample workout routines and a space to track workouts!
* Created with a Postgres database, Node.js, Express.js, React, Material UI, JWT, bcrypt, and much more!
* Includes user authentication, email and password verification, private routes, user quiz that generates custom feedback, and full CRUD for storing information.
